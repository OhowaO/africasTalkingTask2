## Tips
###### Include run and dependency instructions in your README.md file or push a runnable file
###### Comment your code to show your thought process
###### Make sure your project is runnable for this task     


## Solution

## Set up instructions

1. Ensure you have installed on your machine the required version of node

2. Clone the repo to your machine and cd into the folder.

3. Run 'npm start'. The pakage.json file contains a list of dependencies needed for the file and npm start will install all the required dependencies.

4. To add your own survey, add the survey to the survey variable in the variables.js file.


### There is a version of this app that is hosted live on heroku. Simply go to the Africa's talking simulator and dial the respective survey USSD channels.
